## Basics of Web Servers and Nginx Introduction:

#### - Basics of how web servers function.

### Basics of How Web Servers Function:

A web server is software that processes and responds to incoming Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests from clients, typically web browsers. Its primary function is to deliver web content (HTML pages, images, scripts, etc.) to users based on their requests. Here's a simplified overview of how web servers function:

1. **Client Request:**
   - A user initiates a request by entering a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser or clicking on a hyperlink.
   - The browser sends an HTTP request to the server identified by the URL.

2. **DNS Resolution:**
   - The browser performs Domain Name System (DNS) resolution to find the IP address associated with the domain name in the URL.

3. **Establishing Connection:**
   - The browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server's IP address on port 80 (or port 443 for secure, HTTPS connections).

4. **HTTP Request:**
   - The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the resource it wants (e.g., a specific webpage or file).

5. **Server Processing:**
   - The web server receives the HTTP request and processes it. The server may need to execute scripts, fetch data from a database, or perform other tasks based on the request.

6. **Content Generation:**
   - The server generates the appropriate web content based on the request. This can include assembling HTML pages, retrieving images, executing server-side scripts, etc.

7. **HTTP Response:**
   - The server sends an HTTP response back to the client. This response includes the requested content and metadata, such as the status code indicating the success or failure of the request.

8. **Transmission to Client:**
   - The generated content is transmitted from the server to the client over the established TCP connection.

9. **Browser Rendering:**
   - The browser receives the content and renders it for the user to see. This may involve parsing HTML, rendering images, executing JavaScript, and applying styles.

10. **Closing Connection:**
    - After the content is delivered, the server may close the TCP connection, or it may keep it open for subsequent requests if the connection is configured for keep-alive.

### Examples for Better Understanding:

#### Example 1: Simple HTML Page
Let's consider a basic HTML page as the requested resource.

**Client Request:**
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

**Server Processing:**
- The server locates the "index.html" file.

**HTTP Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Example 2: Dynamic Content with PHP
Now, let's consider a request for a dynamic page generated by a server-side script (e.g., PHP).

**Client Request:**
```
GET /dynamic.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

**Server Processing:**
- The server executes the PHP script to generate dynamic content.

**HTTP Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Dynamic Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Current time: <?php echo date("Y-m-d H:i:s"); ?></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Advanced scenarios may involve additional features like caching, load balancing, and security measures, depending on the web server's configuration and purpose.
